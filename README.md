<p align="center">
  A media automation platform that goes beyond the *arr ecosystem. Huntarr hunts for missing content and quality upgrades across your existing Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr, Readarr, and Whisparr instances — while also providing its own built-in Movie Hunt, TV Hunt, Index Master, NZB Hunt, and Requestarr modules that can replace or complement your existing stack.

## What Huntarr Does

Your *arr apps monitor RSS feeds for new releases — but they don't go back and actively search for content already missing from your library. Over time, gaps build up: missing seasons, albums with holes in them, movies stuck below your quality cutoff. Nobody fixes it automatically.

**Huntarr does.** It systematically scans your entire library, identifies all missing content, and searches for it in small, indexer-safe batches that won't get you rate-limited or banned. It also finds content below your quality cutoff and triggers upgrades automatically — completely hands-off.

Beyond missing-content hunting, Huntarr now includes a full suite of built-in modules that can replace parts of your stack entirely or run alongside what you already have:

| Module | What It Does |
|--------|-------------|
| **Movie Hunt** | A built-in movie management system with its own indexers, download clients, and discovery UI — no Radarr required |
| **TV Hunt** | A built-in TV show management system — track series, seasons, and episodes without needing Sonarr |
| **Index Master** | Manage and search your Usenet and torrent indexers directly inside Huntarr — a full Prowlarr alternative |
| **NZB Hunt** | A complete Usenet download client with multi-server support, speed limiting, direct unpack, and a full queue UI |
| **Requestarr** | A media request system with user accounts, approval queues, bundles, and per-user permissions |

The core philosophy: **third-party *arr support is always first-class.** You can use Huntarr's built-in modules, your existing *arr apps, or both simultaneously. Nothing is forced — every module is optional and independently configurable.

---

## Third-Party *arr Support

Huntarr connects to your existing *arr stack and works alongside it. Add multiple instances of the same app and Huntarr hunts across all of them simultaneously, with independent schedules and caps per instance.

| Sonarr | Radarr | Lidarr | Readarr | Whisparr v2 | Whisparr v3 |
|:------:|:------:|:------:|:-------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/readme/ThirdParty.jpg" alt="Third-Party App Connections" width="800">
</p>

Each app connection supports:
- **Missing content hunting** — finds and searches for anything your *arr hasn't picked up yet
- **Quality upgrades** — finds items below your quality cutoff and hunts better versions
- **Multiple instances** — run separate Sonarr instances for 1080p and 4K, each with its own hunt schedule
- **API rate management** — configurable hourly caps per instance so you never overwhelm your indexers

---

## Movie Hunt & TV Hunt

Browse, discover, and manage your media collection with a full visual interface. Movie Hunt and TV Hunt are built-in alternatives to Radarr and Sonarr — see what's in your library, what's missing, and what needs upgrading, all in one place.

**Key capabilities:**
- Visual discovery interface — browse trending, popular, and upcoming titles
- Library management — add, track, and monitor your collection
- Quality profiles — define your preferred formats, resolutions, and cutoffs
- Root folder management — configure where media lands on disk
- Direct import — detect files already on disk and import them without re-downloading
- Requestarr integration — users can request content that flows through your approval queue

Use Movie Hunt and TV Hunt standalone, or alongside your existing Radarr/Sonarr instances. They share indexer and download client configuration through Index Master and NZB Hunt.

---

## Index Master

Manage your indexers directly inside Huntarr. Add Usenet and torrent indexers, test connections, configure API keys, and search across all of them — no separate Prowlarr instance required. Index Master feeds into both the built-in Movie Hunt / TV Hunt modules and the third-party *arr hunting engine.

**Supports:**
- Newznab-compatible Usenet indexers
- Torznab-compatible torrent indexers
- Per-indexer API key and rate limit management
- Connection testing and health status

---

## NZB Hunt

A full Usenet download client built directly into Huntarr. Connect your NNTP servers and download NZBs without installing SABnzbd, NZBGet, or any other download manager.

**Features:**
- Multi-server NNTP connections with up to 120 simultaneous threads
- Direct unpack — extracts RAR archives while downloading, not after
- PAR2 verification and repair for corrupted downloads
- Encrypted RAR detection with configurable action (abort by default on new installs)
- Speed limiting with per-server bandwidth tracking
- Full queue management — pause, resume, prioritize, remove
- Categories — automatic folder organization by movie/TV instance
- Duplicate detection — smart and identical download prevention
- Download history with per-server bandwidth statistics

## Requestarr

A complete media request platform built into Huntarr. Users can discover and request movies and TV shows, requests flow through an owner-controlled approval queue, and approved content is automatically added to the appropriate library.

**Key features:**
- **User accounts** — invite users with per-user permissions and category assignments
- **Approval queue** — owners review and approve or deny requests before anything is added
- **Auto-approve** — grant trusted users instant approval so requests go straight through
- **Bundles** — group multiple instances together so a single request sends to all of them simultaneously; member failures are non-fatal and the system moves on automatically
- **Requestarr works with everything** — Movie Hunt, TV Hunt, Sonarr, Radarr, or any combination
- **Plex integration** — optional Plex SSO lets users log in with their Plex accounts

## Add to Library

Add new movies and TV shows in seconds. Search by title, pick your instance and quality profile, choose a root folder, and send it straight to your library — whether that's through Movie Hunt, TV Hunt, Sonarr, Radarr, or a bundle that hits all of them at once.

Huntarr even detects if files are already sitting on disk and lets you import them directly without re-downloading.

</p>

## How It Works

1. **Connect** — Point Huntarr at your Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr, Readarr, or Whisparr instances (or configure the built-in Movie Hunt / TV Hunt modules)
2. **Hunt Missing** — Scans your entire library for content that's monitored but not downloaded, then searches your indexers in small, safe batches
3. **Hunt Upgrades** — Identifies items that exist but fall below your quality cutoff, then triggers upgrade searches automatically
4. **Smart Rate Management** — Configurable per-instance hourly search caps, automatic pause when download queues are full, and restart delay management to avoid indexer bans
5. **Notifications** — Sends alerts via Discord, Telegram, Pushover, Email, and more when Huntarr grabs something or completes a cycle
6. **Repeat** — Waits for your configured interval, then starts the next cycle. Completely hands-off, continuous library improvement

## Huntarr + Cleanuparr

<p align="center">
  <img src="frontend/static/logo/128.png" alt="Huntarr" width="64" height="64">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <img src="https://github.com/cleanuparr/cleanuparr/blob/main/Logo/128.png?raw=true" alt="Cleanuparr" width="64" height="64">
</p>

Huntarr fills your library. [Cleanuparr](https://github.com/cleanuparr/cleanuparr) protects it.

While Huntarr is out hunting for missing content and upgrading quality, Cleanuparr watches your download queue like a hawk — removing stalled downloads, blocking malicious files, and cleaning up the clutter that builds up over time. One brings content in, the other makes sure only clean downloads get through.

Together they form a self-sustaining media automation loop: Huntarr searches, Cleanuparr filters, and your library grows with zero manual intervention.
